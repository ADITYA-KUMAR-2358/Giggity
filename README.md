# Giggity

## Overview
Giggity is a modern, real-time chat application designed to provide users with a personalized and engaging messaging experience. Each user gets a unique chat box where their messages appear in green and others' messages in white â€” similar to WhatsApp's chat style. The app ensures privacy by clearing chat history every new session, allowing for fresh conversations every time.

Built using **Flask** for the backend and **Firebase Realtime Database** for data storage, Giggity offers seamless communication with a clean, intuitive UI.
